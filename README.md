## Does the brewing method for coffee determine its acidity?
* Designed RCBD experiment to see which brewing method is the most acidic
  + french press, moka pot, or drip
* Used three different roasts of Dunkin coffee which became our blocking factor
  + medium, dark, and decaf
* determined efficiency of our design

The results determined that the bewing method does indeed impact acidity, with the moka pot being the most acidic.
